        <h1>Investing Basics</h1>

        <p>Investing is the act of allocating money with the expectation of generating profits over time. It is a key part of building wealth and achieving any long-term financial goals. The most common types of investments are stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. By understanding the basics of investing, you can make informed decisions and reduce the risks involved.</p>

        <p>One of the most important principles in investing is the relationship between risk and return. Generally, investments that have a higher potential return come with higher risk. This is why you should diversify your investments, which is spreading your money across different asset types. Even small, consistent investments over time can build significant wealth through good planning.</p>
